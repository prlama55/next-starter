## Setting up the project:

```cmake
pnpm create next-app@latest next-starter --typescript --tailwind --eslint
# pnpn is faster than npm and yarn dependency package manager. PNPM creates a non-flat node_modules structure and provides a flattened view of the dependencies through a lockfile.

pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest init
# It's a collection of re-usable UI components with tailwind
```
